The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task.  Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.  Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.\n\nFrom the original data examples with missing values were removed (the majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges of the continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).\n"}, {"name": "forest_fires", "source": "uci", "type": "regression", "url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/162/forest+fires", "id": "162", "description": "\nThe aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data.\n"}, {"name": "liver_disorders", "source": "uci", "type": "regression", "url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/60/liver+disorders", "id": "60", "description": "\nThe first 5 variables are all blood tests which are thought to be sensitive to liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol consumption.

This is incorrect [1]. The 7th field was created by BUPA researchers as a train/test selector. It is not suitable as a dependent variable for classification. The dataset does not contain any variable representing presence or absence of a liver disorder. Researchers who wish to use this dataset as a classification benchmark should follow the method used in experiments by the donor (Forsyth & Rada, 1986, Machine learning: applications in expert systems and information retrieval) and others (e.g. Turney, 1995, Cost-sensitive classification: Empirical evaluation of a hybrid genetic decision tree induction algorithm), who used the 6th field (drinks), after dichotomising, as a dependent variable for classification. Because of widespread misinterpretation in the past, researchers should take care to state their method clearly.\n"}, {"name": "rice_cammeo_and_osmancik", "source": "uci", "type": "classification", "url": "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/545/rice+cammeo+and+osmancik", "id": "545", "description": "\nAmong the certified rice grown in TURKEY,  the  Osmancik species, which has a large planting area since 1997 and the Cammeo species grown since 2014 have been selected for the study.
